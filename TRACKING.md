## D3A
- [x] Present the player with deterministically generated, random-feeling cache locations around the player’s initial location.
- [x] Deterministically generate an offering of coins to collect at each location.
- [x] Represent the player’s location and nearby cache locations on the map with details visible either as tooltips or popups.
- [ ] Allow the player transport coins from one cache to another by collecting and depositing (using buttons in the cache’s popups).
- [ ] Use a latitude–longitude grid where cells are 0.0001 degrees wide. Initialize the player’s location at the site of our classroom in Oakes College at 36°59'22.2"N 122°03'46.0"W. Place a cache at about 10% of the grid cells that are within 8 cell-steps away from the player’s current location.
- [ ] Assume that gameplay is permanently anchored around the Oakes College classroom site.
    - I use player's initial location as the center of gameplay.
- [ ] Assume that all coins are interchangeable (a collection of the can be sufficiently represented by an integer count).
