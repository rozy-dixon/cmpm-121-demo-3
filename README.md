# GeoCoin Carrier

A map-based TypeScript game where players navigate a grid, collect coins, and
interact with caches. The project demonstrates concepts like game design
patterns, software modularization, and adherence to SOLID principles.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow buttons on the screen (or keyboard arrow keys) to navigate the
   player on the map.
2. Collect coins by interacting with caches scattered across the grid.
3. Track your coin progress via the player tooltip.
4. Use the üöÆ button to reset the game or the üåê button to use actual location
   tracking.
